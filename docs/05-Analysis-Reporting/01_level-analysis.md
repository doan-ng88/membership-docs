## Overview

The Level Analysis feature provides comprehensive insights into the distribution, movement, and performance of members across different membership levels. This information helps you optimize your tiered membership strategy.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:
- Analyst or Admin access rights
- Membership levels already defined
- Members assigned to different levels
- Basic understanding of analytics terminology

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Access Level Analysis

1. Log in to the administration system
2. From the left menu, select **Analysis & Reporting > Member Analysis > Level Analysis**

<!-- ![Access Level Analysis](./img/level-analysis-access.png) -->

### 2. View Level Distribution

1. In the **"Level Distribution"** dashboard:
   - View the number and percentage of members in each level
   - See distribution changes over time
   - Filter by date range, registration source, or demographics

2. Analyze visualizations:
   - Pie chart showing current distribution
   - Bar charts comparing levels
   - Line graphs showing trends over time

3. Toggle between count and percentage views

### 3. Analyze Level Transitions

1. Navigate to the **"Level Transitions"** tab
2. View data on how members move between levels:
   - Upgrade patterns (which levels members typically move up to)
   - Downgrade patterns (which levels members typically drop to)
   - Stability (how long members stay in each level)

3. Use the transition matrix to see:
   - Percentage of members moving from one level to another
   - Most common transition paths
   - Levels with highest retention/churn

4. Filter transitions by:
   - Time period
   - Initial level
   - Member demographics

### 4. Review Level Performance

1. Navigate to the **"Level Performance"** tab
2. Compare key metrics across levels:
   - **Average Revenue Per Member**: Spending by level
   - **Purchase Frequency**: Buying habits by level
   - **Average Order Value**: Order size by level
   - **Retention Rate**: Member retention by level
   - **Point Accumulation**: Points earned by level
   - **Engagement Rate**: Platform interaction by level

3. View performance trends over time:
   - Monthly/quarterly/yearly comparisons
   - Seasonal patterns
   - Impact of promotions and campaigns

### 5. Generate Level Reports

1. Click the **"Generate Report"** button
2. Select report type:
   - **Distribution Report**: Current level breakdown
   - **Transition Report**: Movement between levels
   - **Performance Report**: Metrics by level
   - **Comprehensive Report**: All level analytics

3. Configure report parameters:
   - Date range
   - Member segments to include
   - Metrics to highlight
   - Comparison benchmarks

4. Select output format:
   - PDF document
   - Excel spreadsheet
   - CSV data file

5. Click **"Generate"** to create the report

## Best Practices

- **Track level distribution changes** after promotions or policy changes
- **Identify bottlenecks** where members struggle to advance levels
- **Monitor downgrade patterns** to create retention strategies
- **Compare revenue contribution** across levels to measure tier effectiveness
- **Set level-specific goals** based on historical performance
- **Regularly review level transitions** to ensure promotion criteria are appropriate

## Troubleshooting

- **Unexpected level distribution changes**:
  - Check for recent rule changes or system updates
  - Verify automatic level adjustments are functioning correctly
  - Look for bulk member imports or data migrations

- **Missing transition data**:
  - Ensure date range captures level change events
  - Verify level change tracking is enabled
  - Check if system updates have affected data collection

## FAQ

**Q**: How often should I review level analysis reports?
**A**: Monthly reviews are recommended for ongoing monitoring, with quarterly deep dives to inform strategy adjustments.

**Q**: What's the ideal level distribution for a healthy membership program?
**A**: This varies by business model, but typically a pyramid structure (more members in lower levels, fewer in higher levels) with clear paths for advancement is effective.

**Q**: How can I use level analysis to improve member retention?
**A**: Identify at-risk segments by looking for members approaching downgrade thresholds, then create targeted campaigns to encourage activity before downgrades occur.
