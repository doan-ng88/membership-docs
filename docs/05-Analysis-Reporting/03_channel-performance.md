## Best Practices

- **Use consistent UTM parameters** across all campaigns for accurate tracking
- **Establish clear KPIs** for each channel and campaign
- **Compare metrics across similar time periods** to account for seasonality
- **Focus on quality metrics** (conversion, engagement) not just quantity (impressions, clicks)
- **Allocate budget based on performance data**, not assumptions
- **Test and learn** approach with A/B testing of campaigns
- **Look at multi-touch attribution** to understand the full customer journey

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing or incomplete data**:
  - Check UTM parameter implementation
  - Verify tracking code placement
  - Ensure all platforms are properly integrated

- **Inconsistent metrics across reports**:
  - Confirm date ranges match
  - Check for definition differences between platforms
  - Verify correct attribution model is applied

- **Unexpected performance changes**:
  - Check for technical issues (broken links, site downtime)
  - Look for external factors (competitor actions, market changes)
  - Verify spend and budget allocations

## FAQ

**Q**: How long should I run a campaign before evaluating its performance?
**A**: It depends on the channel and campaign type, but generally allow at least 2-4 weeks to gather sufficient data for initial analysis.

**Q**: Which attribution model should I use to measure campaign success?
**A**: This depends on your sales cycle and channels. First-click favors awareness channels, last-click favors conversion channels, and multi-touch models provide a more balanced view.

**Q**: How can I improve low-performing channels?
**A**: Analyze audience targeting, creative content, offers, timing, and landing page experience. A/B test changes to isolate what drives improvement.
