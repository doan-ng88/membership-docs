## Best Practices

- **Review product performance regularly** (weekly or monthly) to identify trends early
- **Compare similar time periods** (year-over-year) to account for seasonality
- **Analyze related products together** to understand category performance
- **Investigate significant changes** in sales volume or revenue
- **Cross-reference with marketing activities** to understand promotion impact
- **Use tags and categories consistently** for accurate reporting
- **Look beyond revenue** to consider profit margins and inventory efficiency

## Troubleshooting

- **Products missing from reports**:
  - Check product categorization and tagging
  - Verify product status (active vs. inactive)
  - Ensure sales data is properly recorded

- **Inconsistent sales data**:
  - Check for duplicate transactions
  - Verify returns and refunds are properly recorded
  - Confirm all sales channels are integrated

- **Reports showing incorrect totals**:
  - Verify filter settings aren't excluding relevant data
  - Check date range selections
  - Ensure currency conversions are handled correctly

## FAQ

**Q**: How can I identify which products contribute most to my profit margin?
**A**: Use the "Profit Margin Analysis" view and sort products by margin percentage or total margin contribution rather than by revenue.

**Q**: What's the best way to identify underperforming products?
**A**: Look for products with declining sales trends, low inventory turnover ratios, or consistently below-average margins compared to their category.

**Q**: How do I determine if a product's sales decline is seasonal or permanent?
**A**: Compare year-over-year performance for the same time period rather than sequential months, and look for consistent patterns across multiple years.
