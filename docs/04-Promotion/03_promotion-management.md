## Best Practices

- **Define clear objectives** for each promotion before launch
- **Track both direct and indirect impacts** of promotions
- **Analyze customer segments** to understand who responds to different offers
- **Monitor cannibalization** of regular-priced sales
- **Calculate true ROI** including all costs (not just discount value)
- **Test different promotion types** to identify what works best for your products
- **Consider long-term value** of customers acquired through promotions
- **Look for halo effects** on non-promoted products

## Troubleshooting

- **Promotions not showing accurate redemption numbers**:
  - Verify tracking codes are properly implemented
  - Check for promotion stacking or overlap issues
  - Ensure all sales channels are reporting correctly

- **ROI calculations seem incorrect**:
  - Verify all promotion costs are included (not just discount value)
  - Check baseline sales calculations
  - Ensure attribution window is appropriate

- **Unable to compare similar promotions**:
  - Standardize promotion tagging and categories
  - Verify time periods are comparable (account for seasonality)
  - Check for external factors that might affect comparison

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I determine if a promotion was successful?
**A**: Look beyond just sales volume to metrics like new customer acquisition, average order value, margin impact, and post-promotion purchase behavior.

**Q**: What's the best way to compare promotions run at different times of year?
**A**: Use year-over-year comparisons for the same season, or calculate lift against baseline sales for the specific time period.

**Q**: How can I prevent promotion fatigue among customers?
**A**: Analyze promotion frequency and customer response rates over time. Look for declining redemption rates or decreasing incremental sales as signs of promotion fatigue.
